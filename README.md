## Building your custom knowledge base
- Use Vector DB
- Use NiFi
- Use Python & more..

## Understanding the User Inputs and Output

### Inputs
**Select Model** - Here the user can select the Llama3 70B parameter chat model (`llama-3-70b`)

**Select Temperature (Randomness of Response)** - Here the user can scale the randomness of the model's response. Lower numbers ensure a more approximate, objective answer while higher numbers encourage model creativity.

**Select Number of Tokens (Length of Response)** - Here several options have been provided. The number of tokens the user uses directly correlate with the length of the response the model returns.

**Question** - Just as it sounds; this is where the user can provide a question to the model

### Outputs
**Response** - This is the response generated by the model given the context in your vector database. Note that if the question cannot correlate to content in your knowledge base, you may get hallucinated responses.


## Deployment

### FastAPI for LLMs
`app` directrory hosts the FastAPI for your LLMs 

### Chatbot UI (Front end)
`chat-ui` directrory hosts the code for Chatbot UI.

### Variables
Look at [Variables](.env.example) when Deploying the AMP. Refer [Cloduera AI Inference](https://www.cloudera.com/products/machine-learning/ai-inference-service.html) Docs to Get Inference endpoint and Key.

## Requirements
#### CML Instance Types
- A GPU instance is required to perform inference on the LLM
  - [CML Documentation: GPUs](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/gpu/topics/ml-gpu.html)
- A CUDA 5.0+ capable GPU instance type is recommended *(This will fail on Step 2 if this requirement is not met)*
  - The torch libraries in this require a GPU with CUDA compute capability 5.0 or higher. (i.e. NVIDIA V100, A100, T4 GPUs)

#### Recommended Runtime
JupyterLab - Python 3.11 - Nvidia GPU

#### AMP Docs
https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/applied-ml-prototypes/topics/ml-amp-project-spec.html

#### Resource Requirements
This creates the following workloads with resource requirements:
- CML Session: `2 CPU, 16GB MEM`
- CML Jobs: `2 CPU, 8GB MEM`
- CML Application: `2 CPU, 1 GPU, 16GB MEM`

#### Default KnowledgeBase
- When this AMP is deployed it will deploy a sample job to build Knowledgebase with Local Milvus from the [Retail Data set](data/retail_kb).

# Interim Fixes
1. Increase Ephemeral Storage Limit by navigating to CML Workspace -> Site Administration -> Settings -> Ephemeral Storage (in GB) and set it to a value >= 50
  - When a CML model is created, the model is loaded in the scratch space of a pod, LLM models are larger than the default 10 GB which causes issues during deployment.

2. Site Administration > Security > Allow applications to be configured with unauthenticated access. (Check the box)
